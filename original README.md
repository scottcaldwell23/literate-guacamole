## Vetspire Take-home (max 2 hours)

Fork this repo. Build a simple full stack app using frameworks of your choice. Submit your results as a pull request
to this repo with instruction on how to build/run it or, even better, a link to where we can see it already
running/deployed.

There is probably more here than can be finished in two hours. Don't worry about completeness. Focus on what's 
important and interesting to you.   

We use `Elixir`, `Ecto`, `Absinthe`, `GraphQL`, `Typescript/Javascript` and `React` at Vetspire but you are welcome to use 
whatever languages and frameworks you prefer.

We encourage you to include a README with notes about your language and framework choices as well as your design 
decisions.
