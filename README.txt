Here is my work on the Take-home.

The two main parts are as follows. "UI", an angular asp.net CORE application, built and debugged using the angular CLI. It is based in typescript. 
"vetspire API", the api. it is build using asp.net framework. I built and debug this with visual studio community 2019.  

I would liked to have added a 3rd project for a service layer. So that it could use dependency injection into the API 
and seperate that logic out from the base API, but I ran out of time. 

Note I unfamiliar with github (my company uses TFS) so I appologize if this check in is oddly formatted or if the pathways got messed up.
I ended up moving my solutions around after creating them and figuring out how VS and github worked together.
